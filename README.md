# Odin Library

Small library webapp, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). The purpose of this project was to practice working with JavaScript objects and prototypes.

Live preview can be found [here](https://ryleyboofa.github.io/odin-library/).

# New skills used

-   **HTML**: Implemented a modal dialog form with various fields and requirements
-   **CSS**: Styled the modal dialog and form for better usability and presentation
-   **JavaScript**: Created and managed objects using prototypal inheritance
